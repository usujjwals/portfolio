        <p>Designed and implemented both an operational OLTP database and a star-schema analytical data warehouse for residential property management. Developed SQL-based ETL pipelines to incrementally load and transform leases, maintenance requests, inspections, staff assignments, and client data, with Type 2 slowly changing dimensions for full historical tracking. Built data-quality checks and pre-built analytical views (occupancy, maintenance turnaround, revenue trends), then created a BI report to visualize key operational and financial metrics.</p>
